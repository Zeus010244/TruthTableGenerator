# TruthTableGenerator

This program takes a Boolean expression as input, generates its complete truth table, and displays the corresponding minterms and maxterms in both canonical and expression form.

The input expression is internally converted into postfix notation using the Shunting-Yard Algorithm for efficient processing.

In addition, you can obtain the most simplified Boolean expression by either:

entering the variables and minterms directly, or

generating them from the truth table output (in case you don’t already have them).

Simplification is handled by the Quine–McCluskey method, adapted into code to minimize boolean expressions. Although the implementations of both algorithms (provided in the Algorithms section) are impossible to understand because of my code's world-class readability, they have been extensively tested and verified.

The entire application is built with JavaFX and packaged using jpackage.
